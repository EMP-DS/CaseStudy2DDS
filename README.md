### Description
DDSAnalytics is an analytics company that specializes in talent management solutions for Fortune 100 companies. Talent management is defined as the iterative process of developing and retaining employees. It may include workforce planning, employee training programs, identifying high-potential employees and reducing/preventing voluntary employee turnover (attrition). To gain a competitive edge over its competition, DDSAnalytics is planning to leverage data science for talent management. The executive leadership has identified predicting employee turnover as its first application of data science for talent management. Before the business green lights the project, they have tasked your data science team to conduct an analysis of existing employee data.

We were provided with a dataset (CaseStudy2-data.csv) with which to do an EDA to identify the top 3 factors that lead to attrition, i.e., the top 3 reasons that lead to an employee quitting. 

### Conclusion
Factors that contributed to attrition were whether or not the employee worked overtime, with those who had "Yes" in their entries generally being more likely to quit.

There was a correlation between monthly income and attrition; those employees making less than $30k per year were more likely to leave, though this makes sense as an employee making less than $30k per year is likely an intern or non-specialized employee.

Job roles and marital status also affected attrition; sales representatives were more likely to leave, as well as single employees.
