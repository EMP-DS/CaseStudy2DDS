### Description
DDSAnalytics is an analytics company that specializes in talent management solutions for Fortune 100 companies. Talent management is defined as the iterative process of developing and retaining employees. It may include workforce planning, employee training programs, identifying high-potential employees and reducing/preventing voluntary employee turnover (attrition). To gain a competitive edge over its competition, DDSAnalytics is planning to leverage data science for talent management. The executive leadership has identified predicting employee turnover as its first application of data science for talent management. Before the business green lights the project, they have tasked your data science team to conduct an analysis of existing employee data.

We were provided with a dataset (CaseStudy2-data.csv) with which to do an EDA to identify the top 3 factors that lead to attrition, i.e., the top 3 reasons that lead to an employee quitting. 

### Conclusion
It was noted that those employees who work overtime are more likely to quit, and there is evidence between rate of attrition and monthly income. Job roles can also play a part in likelihood of attrition, with sales representatives being most likely to leave. A correlation was also found between single employees, while married employees were more likely to stay.
